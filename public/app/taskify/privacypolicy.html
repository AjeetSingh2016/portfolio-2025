<body>

  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Effective date: February 17, 2025</p>

  <p>Taskify ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring compliance with applicable privacy laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), the California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA"), and the California Online Privacy Protection Act ("CalOPPA"). This Privacy Policy explains what personal information we do not collect, how we protect your privacy, and your rights under these laws. Please read this policy carefully.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>At Taskify, we respect your privacy, and we do not collect, store, or process any personal information, such as your name, email address, physical address, or any other personally identifiable information. Taskify does not collect sensitive data like payment details, social security numbers, or health-related information. Our application is designed to work entirely without the need to collect any user data. As a result, no personal information is ever stored or shared by us.</p>

  <h2>2. Use of Personal Information</h2>
  <p>Since Taskify does not collect personal information, we do not process or use your personal data in any way. The application is designed to function fully without requiring user-specific information. We only use your device’s internal storage to save tasks locally on your device, but this does not involve the collection or sharing of personal data. The task data remains on your device and is not uploaded or stored on any external servers.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your personal information to any third parties. As we do not collect any personal information, there is no data to share. Taskify operates independently, without relying on any third-party services for data collection or processing.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Taskify does not use any third-party services, such as analytics, advertising networks, or data processors. We do not integrate any third-party SDKs or services in the app that collect user data. This means that your personal information is not being shared with or sold to any external parties, ensuring full privacy and security.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>Although we do not collect or store any personal information, we take your privacy seriously and implement appropriate measures to safeguard the data you store within the app. Taskify ensures that task data is securely stored on your device using standard encryption and storage protocols. It is your responsibility to keep your device secure by using device-specific security features like passwords, face recognition, or fingerprint authentication.</p>

  <h2>6. Users' Rights Under GDPR</h2>
  <p>For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), Taskify adheres to the principles of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). As we do not collect personal data, many of the rights under GDPR do not apply to our app. However, if you believe that any data collected by Taskify should be rectified, deleted, or restricted, please contact us, and we will take appropriate action. The rights under GDPR include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Right of Access</strong>: The right to request copies of your personal data (Note: Taskify does not collect personal data).</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Rectification</strong>: The right to request correction of inaccurate or incomplete information (Note: No personal data is collected).</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Erasure</strong>: The right to request that your personal data be deleted (Note: No personal data is collected).</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Restriction of Processing</strong>: The right to request restriction of processing of personal data (Note: No personal data is processed).</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Data Portability</strong>: The right to request transfer of personal data to another organization (Note: No personal data is collected).</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Object</strong>: The right to object to the processing of your personal data (Note: No personal data is processed).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. California Privacy Rights (CCPA, CPRA, CalOPPA)</h2>
  <p>California residents have certain rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), and the California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA). These include:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Right to Know</strong>: You can request to know what personal information we have collected about you. However, since Taskify does not collect personal data, no such information is stored.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Delete</strong>: You can request that we delete the personal information we have collected about you. As we do not collect personal data, this right does not apply.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Opt-Out of Sales</strong>: Taskify does not sell personal information, so this right does not apply.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination</strong>: You have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising your privacy rights, including the right to delete or opt-out of the sale of personal data (which does not apply to Taskify).</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Access Information</strong>: You have the right to request access to any personal information we may have. Since we do not collect or store personal data, we do not hold any such information to be accessed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Taskify is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children. If we become aware that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information immediately.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in legal requirements or our business practices. Any updates will be posted here with the updated effective date.
